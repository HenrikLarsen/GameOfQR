## Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway in 1970. It is effectively a zero-player game, meaning that it needs no further input after start.

## How to play
Either insert and convert a text into a QR-Code or take a picture with the camera and play with the pattern converted from it.
The speed slider-bar will allow you to manipulate the size of the cells.

## Rules
The initial rules of Conway's Game of Life are quite simple: If a live cell has two or three neighbours, it survives to the next generation. If a dead cell has exactly three neighbours, it is born. All other conditions result in dead cells. 

There are several other rule variations. You can use the rule drop-down menu to choose from a list of already created rules, or you can experiment with your own combination by writing in the Set Rules box and pressing enter.

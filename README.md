Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway in 1970. It is effectively a zero-player game, meaning that it needs no further input after start.

How to play

Either load a pattern into the game using a file, an URL or the built in pre-sets, or use the left mouse button to draw a pattern on the play board. Then you can press start to start the game, or reset board to go back to a blank slate.

The center view button will take you back to the middle of the board (The center is subject to change whilst the game is running.)

The speed slider-bar will allow you to manipulate the speed of the animation, from 1 to 30 frames per second (FPS)

Rules

The initial rules of Conway's Game of Life are quite simple: If a live cell has two or three neighbours, it survives to the next generation. If a dead cell has exactly three neighbours, it is born. All other conditions result in dead cells.

There are several other rule variations. You can use the rule drop-down menu to choose from a list of already created rules, or you can experiment with your own combination by writing in the Set Rules box and pressing enter.

Controlls:

Scroll Wheel – Zoom in and out.
Left Mouse Button – Draw and erase cells from the board.
Right Mouse Button – Drag the board to look around.
When loading a pattern

Arrow Keys or WASD	– Move the Pattern around
Q – Rotate the loaded pattern counter clockwise
E – Rotate the loaded pattern clockwise.
ENTER – Finalises the pattern and puts it as a permanent part of the board
ESC – Discards the loaded pattern.
